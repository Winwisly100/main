## Golang Server:

- Geo search and reactive updates
- Hooks for integration into our NATS Message queue
	- https://github.com/tidwall/tile38/pull/504
		- NATS hooks is perfect as we can run our NATS cluster and integrate tidwall as a microservice.
	- But also has GRPC and other endpoint integration: https://github.com/tidwall/tile38/tree/master/internal/endpoint
		- These are sends from tile38 to others but easy to add sends the other way around


## Redis Client OR golang wrapper clent ?

- Redis for dart üëç https://redis.io/clients#dart

- If we embed golang inside flutter we dont need this and just use a golang redis client.
	- The tile38 cli is really nice too with very clear API etc.
	- 


## Flutter maps GUI
- integrate tile38 this map gui for real time updates.
https://github.com/johnpryan/flutter_map

Linking: https://pub.dev/packages/map_launcher
- really awesome. We can add our map app as another URL scheme for Mobile and desktop

Image cache and pan and editing: https://github.com/mattermoran/extended_image
- purt dart and will handle alot of corner cases for MAPS but also DOC and CHAT module


## Maps Server

SO we are 100% independent from Google maps etc we can run our own mapping tile server.

Our server is a cache calling out to the open providers.
