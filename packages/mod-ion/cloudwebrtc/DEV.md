Server
https://github.com/cloudwebrtc/flutter-webrtc-server
Yes,If you only need P2P communication, a nodejs server + turn server is enough.
If it is a video conference, live broadcast, you need an SFU, such as mediasoup, ion, etc.
In fact, flutter-webrtc can also use the sip protocol with the sip server, using dart-sip-ua.
