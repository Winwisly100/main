- perfect for a drag and drop cal like GCal.


- but also for the Project KanBan
	- Issues can be created and moved through the Kan Ban
	- If an Issue has a deadline you can link it to the Cal.
		- The Cal can have a dedicated Link GUI as well as TAGS( although i think tags should be global , like food, budget, legal, etc)
