# main

This is the repo where we bring all the modules together into one app.

https://getcouragenow.org/

## Developer setup

You need to make sure you have all the dependencies setup first.

The [bootstrap](https://github.com/winwisely99/bootstrap) repo is for boot strapping your laptop.

Run the examples using the Makefile to ensure you have an environment that works.

## Working on an issue

The [Kan Ban](https://github.com/users/winwisely99/projects/1) should be looked at to work out what to work on.

Is you want to work on an issue, please first ensure that you understand the issue and the suggested approach.

When you take an issue, please assign yourself to it and let everyone know on the Telegram group called "winwisely-dev", so we everyone knows your taking it.

## Builds

Use the Makefiles and keep them working.

If you followed the Developer setup these make files will work on Windows, Mac and Linux.

If they do not work for you then raise an issue so that the bootstrap or Makefile can be fixed for everyone benefit.

## CI and CD

There is no CI / CD yet, but soon there will be.

## Code generation

We make heavy use of code generation.

The grpc - protobuf parts of both client and server are heavy inspired by

Its worth reading this to get an idea of what the system is intended to do.

## Plugins

This project is designed to run on Web, Desktops and Mobiles using Flutter.

This means that plugins must work on all clients and so when choosing a plugin be careful to avoid breaking things.

All plugins that use native code should live here.
https://github.com/winwisely99/plugins

We try to avoid native plugins in general.
